This is my first "bigger" project with React, it started as a small website to display my tshirts, but I wanted to expand it a bit.
I sell t-shirts from time to time and I've always wanted to host my own website. So that's what I did.
It's still work in progress, but the main goal is to deploy a simple website in which you can purchase some of my t-shirts. For now, it's just for learning purposes only, but maybe I will do a rebooted enterprice version ( So many corpo-ass words).
I have recently bought a VPS server, so my goal is to deploy my website there. Wish me luck xoxo
